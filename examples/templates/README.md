# Using Templates

Templates can be used to write a file using the environment data as
content for the template. This is similar to tools such as
[confd](http://www.confd.io/) or
[consul-templates](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template) with
the primary difference being the incoming data is generally from the
environment generated by `we` rather than being limited to data from
the respective service.

To try the example run:

```
$ we -e env.yml -t my.cfg.tmpl cat my.cfg
```

By default, the path of the template will be used, removing the
`.tmpl` extension. You can also explicity define the target of file by
using a `:`.

The equivalent command using `:` would be:

```
$ we -e env.yml -t my.cfg.tmpl:my.cfg cat my.cfg
```

The [sprig](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) functions are
available for helping to manipulate values as necessary.
